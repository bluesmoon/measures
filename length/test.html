The measure is the inside of the black squares.  The width of the yellow square (including border) should be the exact measure, though the height is off by 2px.
<div style="margin:1em;width:1in;height:1in;border:solid 1px black;"><div style="height:100%;border:solid 1px yellow;">1 sq in</div></div>
<div style="margin:1em;width:1cm;height:1cm;border:solid 1px black;"><div style="height:100%;border:solid 1px yellow;">1 cm<sup>2</sup></div></div>
<div style="margin:1em;width:96px;height:96px;border:solid 1px black;"><div style="height:94px;border:solid 1px yellow;">96x96 px<sup>2</sup></div></div>
<p>
Test shows that 1in in CSS is actually <sup>13</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch on a 13" MBP screen, <sup>27</sup>/<sub>32</sub> of an inch on a 15" MBP screen and <sup>23</sup>/<sub>32</sub> of an inch on a 15" Thinkpad running Ubuntu Linux.  In all cases it matched up with 96 pixels, which is expected for a 96dpi display.  An actual inch measured 120 pixels on the 13" MBP, which is what you'd expect for a 120dpi display, but only 112 pixels on the 15", which confuses me and 138 pixels on the Thinkpad.  On a 24" HP monitor, a logical inch is exactly 1 physical inch.

A note about the resolutions used.  The 13" MBP was at 1280x800, the 15" MBP was at 1440x900, and the Thinkpad was at 1680x1050.  The 24" HP was at 1920x1200.  Go ahead and test it on your own screens.
